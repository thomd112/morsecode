        <p>What is Morse Code?</p>
<br>
        <p>Morse code is a language named after Samuel Morse and other inventors who helped establish this in the early 19th century. Electric signals were passed to allow communication through these two signal durations.
          <p>This website presents the international Morse code. 
            The International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters A through Z. Upper and lower case letters are the same. Morse code symbols are formed by dits and dahs. The short bursts of sound or light are called “dit”, and the long bursts are called “dah”.</p>
          <p> Visually, they are written: . are dits    _ are dahs </p> <p>The Morse system was first based on the English alphabet, but did not work for other languages. In 1848, Fredrich Clemens Gerke refined the Morse Code into the Hamburg Alphabet. It's this alphabet that we now know as the International Morse Code.</p>
